# shopApp
SELF-DIRECTED TASK for Computer Science course
a) Implement the Product class.
(3 marks)

b) Develop a ShopApp program that holds 5 Product objects in an
array, representing products sold in a shop. The ShopApp program
should provide a allow users to display all products, buy stock, sell
stock, re-price an item of stock and display the total value of all stock
in the shop.
Your student number should be displayed at the top of the interface
and extra credit will be given for developing a menu driven interface,
for some input validation and the use of methods.
(7 marks)
Note, you can tackle a simpler task to display, buy, sell and re-price a
single Product object (rather than 5 Product objects in an array) â€“ but
this can only earn a maximum of 3 marks.

c) Once the ShopApp program is complete, fill in the program review
table on the following page.
